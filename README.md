# Dtse3

## Global Requirements
To use everything this ships with, you need the following installed on your machine:

* NPM

## Installation
1. Clone the repository & cd into the site's directory
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/brianotoole/dts-e3.git
cd dts-e3
```

2. Install project dependencies
``` bash
npm install
```

3. Start server
The boilerplate comes preset with css/js file inclusions, base meta settings, and a basic semantic body with a few modules to get you started. However, to make full use of the site-start though, you'll want to use Webpack.

``` bash
npm run-script watch
```

4. Open browser to: http://localhost:3000/dts-e3
